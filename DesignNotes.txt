Specs of the Zotino (https://github.com/sinara-hw/Zotino/wiki):
>Output impedance of DAC is 500ohm with 2.2nF in parallel
>Output amplifier: OPA197
>All together, the output of the DACs has a 3rd-order Butterworth response with 75kHz cutoff frequency


Options for amplifier:
>OPA454 [296-41370-1-ND] //highest voltage
>OPA542 [296-15965-1-ND]
>OPA445 [OPA445AU-ND] //the one from the old LL design

>D-Sub connector:
>>5787082-7 [A31814-ND]


General thoughts:
>Would it be possible to use a boost converter and drive the amps directly from the output of the Zotino?
>>Could check out the schematics for the Zotino to see how this is done without getting too much noise
>>[LT3471EDD#TRPBFCT-ND]

General notes about using KiCAD:
>Select a component and go to properties; from here you can edit the library reference to change the library that the symbol derives from
>http://docs.kicad-pcb.org/5.1.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/getting_started_in_kicad.html
>It would appear that setting up the libraries I have done, by using path substitutions in (Preferences>Manage symbol libraries...) has succeeded in making the project portable


Still ToDo:
>[CRITICAL] Figure out if it's possible to have hierarchical layouts similar to the schematics
>>>https://forum.kicad.info/t/hierarchical-sheets-and-pcb/6053/5
>>>The trick seems to be to use the standalone version of the PCB editor, which allows you to append board designs with other PCB files.  Unclear how much time this is really going to save for me, but should look in to it.
>Figure out the best default connection for the unused pins of the OPA454
>[OPTIONAL] Figure out how to make a nice 3D model of the HD68 connector

Notes from dreens:
-I've added protection diodes to the design- first of all polarity protection diodes on the power supply, and also 70 V steering diodes on the input to the amplifiers. 
-I wasn't able to protect the output for lack of high enough voltage diodes in a small enough form factor.
-I've also added u.FL pickoffs before the input to the amplifier to enable network analysis of the transfer function through the amps for shuttling predistortion computations.
-PCB Unlimited had trouble getting the differential chokes to solder. Something about the feet not being exposed enough? 
-I guess maybe they're laser heating the pads and couldn't get it to heat enough.
