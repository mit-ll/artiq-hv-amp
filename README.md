# artiq-hv-amp

Schematic designs for a 1U rack mountable amplifier for the Zotino and Fastino. 

These are from the sinara family of DACs (https://github.com/sinara-hw/Zotino, https://github.com/sinara-hw/Fastino) and output 32 channels from -10 to +10 V and offer similar capabilities to the underlying AD9910 and AD9912 DACs from analog devices on which these cards are based. The amplifiers in this repository provide the following capabilities:

1. x4 amplification based on Linear's LTC6090 low noise HV amp.
2. Differential pair routing and differential inductors on all outputs.
3. MHz bandwidth and low output impedance.
4. Differentially paired HD68 input/output compatible with zotino, fastino.
5. ESD protection on all outputs with high speed low capacitance diodes.
6. Reverse polarity protection on high voltage input power.
